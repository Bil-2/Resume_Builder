## 🎯 MY DECISION: **Render.com**

### Why I chose this:
1. **100% FREE** - No credit card, no trials, free forever
2. **One platform** - Frontend + Backend together
3. **Simple deployment** - Connect GitHub and deploy
4. **MongoDB Atlas FREE tier** - 512 MB free database
5. **Professional** - Used by many companies
6. **Reliable** - Good uptime
7. **Perfect for selling** - Buyer can easily upgrade

### The Only "Downside":
- Free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Wakes up in ~30 seconds on first request
- **Not a problem** because:
  - While you're selling, buyers will test it immediately
  - Once sold, buyer will upgrade to paid tier ($7/month)
  - For demo purposes, it's perfect
